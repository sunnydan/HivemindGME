# The Hivemind Game Master Emulator

The Hivemind GM Emulator is a system/oracle that can be asked any question, and then quickly gathers answers from all the players present. It then randomly picks one, and responds with that answer. Every player acts as the GM while answering a question.

## Instructions

To use it, pick a room name and a username, and click "Join/Create Room". Once all your players are in the room, anybody can enter a question, and then the whole room can answer it. The system detects whether a question is a Yes or No question, a numeric question, or an open-ended question, and provides different interfaces to try and make providing a good answer as expedient as possible. The Instructions link at the bottom of a the page provides a better overview of all the features.
