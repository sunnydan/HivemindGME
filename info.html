            <ul class="browser-default discList" style="text-align: left;">
              <li>Type in a room name and a username for yourself, and click &quot;Join Room&quot; to begin. If a room with that name does not already exist, one will be created.</li>
              <li>The section of the interface with a green border is the &quot;active&quot; part of the interface. You cannot interact with the inactive part of the interface.</li>
              <li>Type in a question and click or press Enter to pose a question to the Hivemind GM. All the players in the room will then get a chance to submit an answer. An answer will be randomly selected among all those given to be the final
                answer, which the system will respond with.</li>
              <li>The system recognizes 3 types of question: Yes or No questions, Numeric questions, and Open-ended questions. Each of these types of question has their own answering interface to make providing an answer as easy as possible.
                <ul class="browser-default circleList">
                  <li>Yes or No questions begin with: &quot;am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;did&quot;, &quot;has&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;was&quot;, &quot;does&quot;, &quot;have&quot;,
                    &quot;were&quot;,
                    &quot;will&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;would&quot;, or &quot;should.&quot;</li>
                  <li>Numeric questions begin with: &quot;how many&quot;, &quot;how much&quot;, or &quot;how few&quot;</li>
                  <li>All other entered questions are assumed to be Open-ended.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>If you want to ask a question like, &quot;How far is it to the next town?&quot; and want to use the Numeric answering interface, instead phrase your question like, &quot;How many miles is it to the next town?&quot;</li>
              <li>The first player to submit an answer to any question will start a timer. A final answer will be selected upon the timer running out, regardless of how many players have submitted an answer.
                <ul class="browser-default circleList">
                  <li>Yes or No questions have a default timer of 10 seconds.</li>
                  <li>Numeric questions have a default timer of 20 seconds.</li>
                  <li>Open-ended questions have a default timer of 30 seconds.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>&nbsp;The system will respond with &quot;No Answer&quot; if no answers have been submitted by the time the timer runs out, or if all players in the room Abstain from submitting an answer.</li>
              <li>Enabling the &quot;Allow players to make statements?&quot; setting will allow players to post 'statements' directly to the log.</li>
              <li>There is a small chance that Something Unexpected will happen after any answer. The chance of this happening can be turned off or configured in the settings.</li>
              <li>For groups of players that are on a voice call or in the same room as each other, there is &quot;Live Play Mode&quot;. Live play mode assumes that every player hears the question spoken aloud, and allows you to simply press a button with the type of question you think it is to start the answer poll. Typed questions will also not show who asked them in this mode, so that players can ask questions without having to speak it aloud if they wish.</li>
