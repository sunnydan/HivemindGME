      <ul>
        <li>Type in a room name and a username for yourself, and click &quot;Join Room&quot; to begin. If a room with that name does not already exist, one will be created.</li><br>
        <li>The section of the interface with a green border is the &quot;active&quot; part of the interface. You cannot interact with the inactive part of the interface.</li><br>
        <li>Type in a question and click or press Enter to pose a question to the Hivemind GM. All the players in the room will then get a chance to submit an answer. An answer will be randomly selected among all those given to be the final answer,
          which the system will respond with.</li><br>
        <li>The system recognizes 3 types of question: Yes or No questions, Numeric questions, and Open-ended questions. Each of these types of question has their own answering interface to make providing an answer as easy as possible.<ul>
            <br>
            <li>Yes or No questions begin with: &quot;am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;did&quot;, &quot;has&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;was&quot;, &quot;does&quot;, &quot;have&quot;,
              &quot;were&quot;,
              &quot;will&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;would&quot;, or &quot;should.&quot;</li><br>
            <li>Numeric questions begin with: &quot;how many&quot;, &quot;how much&quot;, or &quot;how few&quot;</li><br>
            <li>All other entered questions are assumed to be Open-ended.</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li>If you want to ask a question like, &quot;How far is it to the next town?&quot; and want to use the Numeric answering interface, instead phrase your question like, &quot;How many miles is it to the next town?&quot;</li>
        <br>
        <li>The first player to submit an answer to any question will start a timer. A final answer will be selected upon the timer running out, regardless of how many players have submitted an answer.<ul>
            <br>
            <li>Yes or No questions have a timer of 10 seconds.</li><br>
            <li>Numeric questions have a timer of 20 seconds.</li><br>
            <li>Open-ended questions have a timer of 30 seconds.</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li>&nbsp;The system will respond with &quot;No Answer&quot; if no answers have been submitted by the time the timer runs out, or if all players in the room Abstain from submitting an answer.</li>
